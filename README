* What is parmpi?

This tool runs a number of jobs in parallel over MPI. It is kind of like xargs
-P but can run on several machines at the same time.

* Motivation

It is very useful if you have a large number of small command line jobs that
need to be run and you have several computers to do computations on. It
behaves in a way like a mini scheduler that can run inside a scheduler on a
computing cluster. A standard job scheduler like TORQUE is not able to handle
a large quantity of jobs or jobs that are very shortlived.

* Usage

usage example:
usage: mpirun -n 3 parmpi < list_of_commands.txt

where list_of_commands.txt contains the jobs to execute separated with a
newline.
